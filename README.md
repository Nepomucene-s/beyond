We want to create a game where the player must displace a 4Dimensonial object in a 4Dimensional environment.
Of course the player has only access to the 3D projection of the object in the volume they live in.
The objective is to create a 'feeling' or 'sense' of 4d objects through the direct manipulation of them.
